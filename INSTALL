You will need a working iraf and sextractor to run phcat.py, if you are happy
with just sextractor, phcat.py -I does just that - it skips the IRAF part and
saves the sextractor output.

dophot3.py is the main call, if you run into problems, do not hesitate to contact me.

Since the online catalogs are available, this step is not critical, but you may
still want to download the Atlas catalogue from the Intenet.
https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/atlas-refcat2/, "Original Format, Scaled
Integer Columns".  Once you have it, compile the provided (modified original)
atlas.c, and place the resulting atlas binary to your $PATH. At present, the
catalog path is hard coded in the source, so you will need to find the path and
modify it. I will fix it, I promise. 
cc -lm atlas.c -o atlas
install -m 666 atlas /usr/local/bin
