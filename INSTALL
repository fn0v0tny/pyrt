You will need to get a working atlas binary to your $PATH

There used to be a dependency on atpy and kapteyn, but they turned out
problematic and recent versions were stripped of both. Anyway, there may be
some forgotten code, so if I it complains try one of these:

pip install atpy
pip install kapteyn (may not work, then kapteyn from source)
