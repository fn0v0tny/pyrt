You need to download atlas catalogue from the Intenet (or ask me if it fails)
Then compile the provided (modified original) atlas.c, and place the resulting atlas binary to your $PATH
cc -lm atlas.c -o atlas
install -m 666 atlas /usr/local/bin

At present, the catalog path is hard coded in the source, so you will need to find the path and modify it. 
I will fix it, I promise. 

You will need a working iraf and sextractor to run phcat.py, if you are happy with just sextractor, 
phcat.py can be easily modified to do just that. 

It should work then. If you run into problems, do not hesitate to contact me.
